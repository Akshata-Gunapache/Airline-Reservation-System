# Online_Airline-Reservation-System
The Online Airline Reservation System (OARS) has been designed to streamline the airline booking and management processes. The primary goal of this project is to create, implement, and maintain a robust OARS to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in handling airline reservations and related operations.

* Establish a centralized database for flight details, seat availability, and airline information to facilitate efficient management.
* Implement real-time seat availability monitoring for optimal utilization and seamless passenger booking experiences.
* Enhance ticket booking capabilities, ensuring swift and error-free reservations.
* Provide an intuitive user interface for both passengers and airline staff, minimizing the learning curve.
* Enable comprehensive reporting and analytics, including passenger reviews for future enhancements.
* Implement role-based access control to preserve data privacy.
# Modules
The Airline Reservation System is divided into several modules, each serving a specific function to ensure a well-organized and efficient system.

* Module 1: Flight Search and Ticket Booking
This module allows users to view available flights, check seat availability, and book tickets for their desired travel dates.

Implementation: PHP scripts handle basic CRUD operations for flight information. HTML forms collect user input and interact with the MySQL database to update the flight details and manage ticket reservations.
* Module 2: Passenger Feedback and Ratings
This module enables passengers to provide reviews, ratings, and feedback based on their flight experiences. 

Implementation: PHP scripts handle CRUD operations for passenger feedback. HTML forms collect user input and interact with the MySQL database to update passenger information and their respective flight details.
* Module 3: Admin Authentication and Flight Availability
Admins can log in to view total flights scheduled for the day, available seats, total airlines.

Implementation: PHP scripts handle flight availability, connecting to the MySQL database. Access control is implemented to restrict functionalities to admins.
*Module45: Add new Flight schedules
Admins can schedule new flights and generate the flight details.

Implementation: PHP scripts retrieve relevant data from the database and format it into reports. HTML and CSS are used to present reports in a user-friendly manner for easy assessment.
